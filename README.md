# My Certifications  
You may be curious to know why I would personally put my certifications in a GitHub repo? This is not "normal" behavior!  
Well, I am not a normal person either!  
I placed my certifications here so that when people ask, I can tell them to go to;  
github.com/CryptoH4ck3r/Certs  
And anyone can see the certifications I have!
